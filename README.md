[Red Faction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Faction) Game Tracker
========================

An alternative game tracker server, compatible with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Faction">Red Faction</a> binary protocol.
This tracker was created because of plans of the official tracker going down.

- rfgt - server
- rfgt2txt - client for extracting server list (should work with official tracker)
- rfgtreload - sends reload signal to server to re-read list of static servers

Thanks to Mr.H for the idea, help with decoding rfgt protocol and hosting the rfgt server itself.
